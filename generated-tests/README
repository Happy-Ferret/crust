This directory contains pre-generated tests for data structures from the Rust
standard library.

To compile these tests, you must apply `rustc-no-privacy-check.patch` to your
Rust compiler (or otherwise change all `span_err` to `span_warn` in the
definition of `rustc_privacy::PrivacyVisitor`).  The patch will downgrade the
error about accessing private fields to a warning, so that the tests can check
for invalid references inside fields of returned structures (such as
iterators).

The tests refer to the libraries `__crust` (low-level Crust verifier
intrinsics) and `__crust2` (higher-level wrappers).  You can build a stub
version of `__crust` from `../src/crust-stubs.rs`.  Then build `__crust2` from
`../src/crust.rs`.  Once those are built, you can compile the test code in this
directory.
